      section
        h2 It is tempting to believe that you already know what customers want, and that your idea is good enough to try out in the real world

      section
        h2 Look at it this way...

      section
        h2 Let's assume that most Silicon Valley based startups, their investors, advisors, mentors etc are actually not completely clueless

      section
        h2 Let's assume that they are actually smart, creative people with lots of experience (Thousands of startups)...

      section
        h2 Let's assume that they most often start with building a beta version (Veeeery common)...

      section
        h2 But still:

      section
        h2 The overwhelming majority of these startups will fail

      section
        h2 Also, there is a huge difference in efforts, for practically the same learning
        ul
          li
          li Start with building a beta version: 100-400 hours of unpaid work + $1000-25000 investment necessary

          li Start with customer-needs and market research: 10-100 hours of unpaid work + $100-1000 investment necessary

      section

          //- before when the idea instead better be revised and improved before actually being tested as a full-blown startup idea.
          li This may be practical for them, since their goal may be to "stimulate innovation" and fearing that their advisees will give up and look for employment instead, they rather see them trying out their ideas in a startup.
          li Even many investors will invest in premature ideas for the fun of it, even when they suspect beforehand that the idea won't fly.

          //- li To define just what "faster" or "better" means, companies must be able to capture from customers the set of metrics—measures of value, if you will—that define how they want to get the job done and what it means to get the job done perfectly.

          li Besides getting more jobs done, or a specific job done better, customers also need help overcoming the constraints that prevent them from getting a job done altogether or under certain circumstances.
          li Functional constraints are often physical, regulatory, or environmental in nature.
          li Emotional constraints (Personal, Social) are often cultural, moral or ethical in nature.

        ul
          li
          li New <strong>jobs</strong> are created over time, old ones abandoned, but for the most time, jobs are constant over time

        ul
          li
          li Most customers are mostly unaware of which exact job steps they perform, what desired outcomes they value and what constraints hold them down, and can at most list a handful of them from the top of their mind
          li For most jobs, even those that may seem somewhat trivial, there are typically 50 to 150 or more desired outcomes

      section
        h1 Part 3 - Releasing your next product/service
        h2 What to release and when?

      section
        h2 This is what you want to release in the first weeks
        ul
          li
          li Day 1 - Your dreams and inspirations (To family, friends and co-founders)
          li Week 1-2 - Your requests to meet up and talk with those in your broader customer type
          li Week 4-6 - Your innovation survey (Hint: Buy good relevant survey responses from audience services)
          li Week 6-8 - A marketing page which includes a rough first version of your offerings
          li Week 9-10 - Marketing efforts/campaigns for validation, learning and price-gauging (Cost-per-click paid advertising may be fine to start with)

      section
        h2 Q: What about the actual product/service?

      section
        h2 A: First of all, forget about the notion of releasing a "product". It is never done in a vacuum.
        h3 You are offering value delivered from your company as a whole, which may include the customer getting access to a product/service but the customer will always gauge the complete value she gets from the relation with your company, not the product in itself.

      section
        h2 With that in mind, this is a generalized "Release schedule"
        ul
          li
          li Whenever your company can offer real value to your single most ideal customer, release to them
          li Whenever your company can offer real value to your first ideal customer target segment, release to them
          li Whenever your company can offer real value to another highly ideal customer target segment, release to them
          li etc

      section
        h2 Be creative! Try to release as early and as often as possible!
        h3 There is nothing that states that you need to build a product/service to deliver real value

      section
        h2 Example 1
        h3 Release a whitepaper that outlines the business case for something relevant to your future offering in exchange for feedback or getting them to join a mailing list

      section
        h2 Example 2
        h3 Release a competition in which one potential customer wins free consultancy hours for advice in how they can improve their business (in general), free installation and integration of an early access prototype, a year of premium support or similar etc

      section
        h2 Example 3
        h3 Release early access to a tutorial or other documentation which helps the customer and yourselves gauge how well the solution might fit

      section
        h2 Don't release without a reason
        h3 You want to be looking for the ability to gain critical insights in how well the solution will be aligned with the customer's need in order to prevent mistakes in the design of your solution
        h3 If you don't have a plan to follow up on these early releases, you might skip them altogether

      section
        h1 Part 4 - Pricing your next product/service

      section
        h2 The trickiest part!
        h3

      section
        h2 In the end, you are always selling to an individual - a human being
        h3 Understand who that individual is, how he thinks and what he eats for breakfast. Seriously

      section
        h2 Human beings are NOT RATIONAL
        h3 This may be the single most important thing to understand

      section
        h2 Read this book!
        img.subimage.subimage--book-large(src='images/book-thinking.jpg',style='float:right;margin-bottom:1em;')
        h3 "Thinking - Fast and slow" by Daniel Kahneman

      section
        h1 Value in the eyes of the customer

      section
        h2 The human being does not buy a product or service
        h3 As mentioned previously, the customer will always gauge the complete value she gets from the relation with your company, not the product in itself

      section
        h2 A low price is almost never the most important customer need

      section
        h2 The price is only related to one of between 50-100 desired outcomes
        h3 "How important is it that the price is low?"

      section
        h2 The customer needs to perceive that they will get value for doing business with your company

      section
        h2 Customer value equation
        img.subimage.subimage--value-eq(src='images/value-eq.png')

      section
        h2 Negative Value is NOT remotely the same as the Price

      section
        h2 Take your time grasping the whole picture!
        img.subimage.subimage--process(src='images/the-self-employed-procrastinator-slash-entrepreneurs-fiscal-era-accounting-life-cycle.png',style='float:right;')

      section
        h2 Changing workflows is often a huge cost for your customer
        h3 It does not matter if you give away your product for free! (Or everyone would be using open source software...)

      section
        h2 Net Value-Add is the additional value of your solution helping your customer achieve their desired outcomes better than the alternatives

      section
        h2 Your competitors are NOT the alternatives
        h3 Which was the alternative to McDonald's milkshakes?

      section
        h2 Burger King's milkshakes? Soda?

      section
        h1 NO!

      section
        h2 The answer is
        h1 The Banana

      section
        h2 Why?
        h3 Customer interviews showed that the people buying milk shakes where those that were going to work knowing they would be stuck in traffic. They may had skipped breakfast and wanted something that kept them from feeling peckish on the way to work. The milkshake is easy to sip from while driving, lasts quite a while and doesn't make a mess. The mornings when they did not have time to buy a milkshake, they'd grab a banana instead.

        h2 Got it?
        h3 Let's try to set a price for your product now

      section
        h2 Coming up with an initial price
        ul
          li
          li Estimate the monetary value of desired outcomes and substract value of undesired outcomes
          li You end up with a net monetary value that customers will gain by using your product
          li Divide by 10 to get a good starting price that reflects what the customer may be willing to pay

      section
        h2 Keeping it simple at the beginning
        h3 Offer an unrestricted "early adopter" subscription plan which is made available to a restricted number of users (1, 10, 100 etc you decide)

      section
        h2 In the end, choose an initial price that feels good

      section
        h2 Test your initial price
        h3 "Only intel from paying customers is valid when you’re trying to get intel on how to charge customers. Think about that for a minute."
        p - Lincoln Murphy
        //- Pricing (like pretty much everything) is never a set-it-and-forget-it situation, and that’s never more so than in the beginning.

      section
        h2 Increase your initial price gradually

      section
        h2 Stop when you are seeing a clear decrease in sales

      section
        h2 Real world example of this initial pricing strategy
        h3 Hemsida24.se - The most popular website builder in Sweden

      section
        h2 Today around 15.000 paying customers, paying at least 99 SEK / month
        h3 How did they arrive at 99 SEK / month? (Around $11 / month)

      section
        h2 Their ideal customer that they chose
        h3 ... was the members of the model photography community which they ran at the time
        h3 They had realized that most of them wanted their own web site

      section
        h2 Started by pitching the concept and a price to friends, family, colleagues and journalists they thought was right
        h3 500-600 SEK per year

      section
        h2 Feedback from a journalist
        h3 It is too low!

      section
        h3 So they chose to think about a new official list price, and try it out by offering limited in time and introductionary discounts
        ul
          li
          li First month: 495 SEK per year (Ordinary price 1495 SEK per year)
          li Second month: 695 SEK per year (Ordinary price 1495 SEK per year)
          li Third month: 995 SEK per year (Ordinary price 1495 SEK per year)
          li Fourth month: 1195 SEK per year (Ordinary price 1495 SEK per year)
          li Started to notice pushback
          li Fifth month: 1395 SEK per year (Ordinary price 1495 SEK per year)
          li Noticed significant pushback
          li Went back to 99 SEK per month (around 1195 SEK per year)

          .bullet Step 6 out of 6
        h3
          .bullet Adopt outcome-driven thinking and apply life experiences in your first successful startup

      section
        h2 Useful life experiences
        ul
          li Understand actual value (Price != Cost, ROI != Value)
          li Understand who and where you are and what you want to achieve
          li Understand which ones to listen to
          li Understand scale, exponentiality
          //- Most things simply don't scale. Why? Because we are wired to think linearly and we have never been able to help more than a handful of people at a time for thousands of years.
          li Remove manual labor, think systems
          li Understand systems of value creation
          li Understand true cost of using a third party service
          li Understand the true cost of doing anything out of the ordinary
          li Understand cognitive burden
          li Don't forget emotional jobs (personal and social)
          li Understand that you and everyone involved in a business needs to get paid for every second of work
